**Objective**: Develop a 3D graphical representation of a maze using a first-person perspective through ray-casting principles.  

    File Types: Accept input maps in the *.cub format.
    Makefile: Include commands for all, clean, fclean, re, and bonus.

**Funtions**: Utilize the following system calls and libraries.

    System Calls: open, close, read, write, malloc, free, perror, strerror, exit, and gettimeofday.
    Math Library Functions: All functions from the math library (-lm).
    MinilibX Functions: All functions within the MinilibX graphics library.
    LIBFT is also permitted. 
  
This project will focus on creating a realistic visualization using ray-casting techniques, aiming to effectively simulate the experience of navigating through a maze.
